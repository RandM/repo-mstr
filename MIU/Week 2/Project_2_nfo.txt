Hi Ms. Alarcon,

Thank you again for letting me know about my files. I started working on my project after I turned in my Project 2, but I tried to reverse back to where I was before. So I left a few things that were not functional like it was when I turned in my assignment.

Thank you,
Randy Mathews
